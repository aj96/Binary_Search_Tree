# Binary_Search_Tree

Synopsis
--------

About binary search trees: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree

This is to show off a rust library I made which contains two structs Tree<T> and TreeNode<T>, which are used to create a binary search tree. You can find and insert treenodes, as well as conduct a post-order traversal, an in-order traversal, and a pre-order traversal and obtain the respective vectors containing all the keys. 

The main.rs file shows how to test the library. 

Motivation
----------

To teach myself how to program in Rust.

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have Rust installed...

Open an empty directory in your computer. Run the commands:

$ cargo new Binary_Search_Tree --bin

$ cd Binary_Search_Tree

Download the main.rs and lib.rs of this repository into the src folder of Binary_Search_Tree. Then run the command:

$ cargo run
